        <!-- FAQ rows -->
        <details class="faq-row" open>
          <summary>How often are the treatments? How many per season?</summary>
          <p>
            Our treatments are scheduled every <strong>3–4 weeks</strong> during peak mosquito activity.
            A typical season includes about <strong>six visits</strong>, from spring through fall, to keep
            mosquito and tick populations consistently suppressed.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-row">
          <summary>Do you service my area?</summary>
          <p>
            We currently serve much of northern Delaware and nearby communities, including:

            we’ll confirm availability.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-row">
          <summary>What do I need to do after the treatment?</summary>
          <p>
            You can improve results by removing standing water around your yard — look for clogged gutters,
            birdbaths, flowerpot saucers, toys, and other water-holding containers. Keeping grass and
            vegetation trimmed also reduces mosquito hiding spots and helps treatments work more effectively.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:.4rem;">
            After we treat, we recommend allowing <strong>at least one hour</strong> for the product to dry
            before people and pets re-enter treated areas (longer if conditions are very humid or shady).
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-row">
          <summary>Are these products safe?</summary>
          <p>
            We use EPA-registered products that are labeled for residential mosquito and tick control. When
            applied correctly by trained technicians, they are considered safe for people, pets, and the
            environment.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:.4rem;">
            As a precaution, we ask that people and pets stay indoors until the application is completely dry
            — typically about an hour.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-row">
          <summary>Is this service safe for native insects and pollinators?</summary>
          <p>
            Our treatments are designed to target the areas where mosquitoes and ticks rest — such as turf
            edges, dense shrubs, and ornamental beds. We <strong>avoid spraying blooms</strong> or flowering
            plants where bees and other pollinators typically forage.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:.4rem;">
            While any insecticide can be harmful if a pollinator is directly contacted, we follow best
            practices to minimize that risk. As beekeepers and pollinator advocates ourselves, we take that
            responsibility seriously.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-row">
          <summary>Do you treat commercial properties and events?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. In addition to residential properties, we provide services for commercial sites and
            <strong> one-time events</strong> such as weddings, outdoor parties, and corporate gatherings.
            Contact us with the event date and location so we can hold a spot on the schedule.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-row">
          <summary>What other services do you offer?</summary>
          <p>
            Through Mosquito Solutions and our partnered brands, we can connect you with additional lawn and
            outdoor services. If you have specific needs beyond mosquito and tick control, let us know and
            we’ll point you in the right direction.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-row">
          <summary>How long does a typical visit take?</summary>
          <p>
            Most standard residential applications take <strong>20–30 minutes</strong>, depending on the
            size and complexity of the property. Larger or heavily wooded lots may take a bit longer.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-row">
          <summary>Do I need to be home for each treatment?</summary>
          <p>
            You do not need to be home as long as we have access to the areas we’re treating. Many of our
            customers are at work during service. We’ll leave a door hanger or send a notification so you
            know we were there.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-row">
          <summary>What happens if it rains?</summary>
          <p>
            Light rain after an application usually does not affect results once the product has dried.
            If there is heavy rain immediately after a treatment and you feel performance has been reduced,
            please contact us — we’ll review the situation and make it right.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-row">
          <summary>How much does the service cost?</summary>
          <p>
            Pricing depends on factors such as property size, landscaping, and whether you’re signing up for
            a full season or a single event. The best way to get accurate pricing is to request a free quote.

          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-row">
          <summary>Can I pause or cancel service?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. We don’t require long-term contracts. If you need to pause service temporarily or cancel
            for any reason, just let us know before the next scheduled visit and we’ll update your account.
